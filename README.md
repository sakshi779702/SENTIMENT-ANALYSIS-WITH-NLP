Project Overview:

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we build a sentiment analysis model using customer review data. The primary goal is to classify reviews as either positive or negative, thereby helping businesses and platforms automatically analyze customer feedback.

This project uses TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical form and applies Logistic Regression, a popular and interpretable classification algorithm, to make predictions. The entire pipeline is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to understand, visualize, and modify.

Dataset:
We work with a sample dataset consisting of ten customer reviews labeled with their respective sentiments:
1 for positive sentiment.
0 for negative sentiment.

Each review expresses an opinion about a product or service, and the dataset is designed to be easily replaceable with larger, real-world datasets like IMDb, Yelp, or Amazon reviews.

Workflow:
Importing Libraries:
Essential Python libraries such as pandas, sklearn, and TfidfVectorizer are imported for data handling, vectorization, modeling, and evaluation.

Data Preparation:
The dataset is structured in a Pandas DataFrame with two columns: review and sentiment. This setup mimics real-world review datasets.

Text Preprocessing and Vectorization:
Text data is inherently unstructured and needs to be converted into a structured numerical format. We use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization, which not only considers the frequency of words in a document but also penalizes commonly occurring words across all documents. This improves the quality of features used by the machine learning model.

Splitting Data:
The dataset is split into training and test sets using an 80-20 ratio. The training set is used to train the logistic regression model, and the test set is used to evaluate its performance.

Model Training:
A Logistic Regression classifier is trained on the TF-IDF features. Logistic Regression is chosen for its simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability, especially in binary classification tasks like sentiment analysis.

Model Evaluation:
After training, the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated on the test data using accuracy and a classification report (which includes precision, recall, and F1-score). These metrics help assess how well the model distinguishes between positive and negative sentiments.

Applications:
This sentiment analysis system has numerous practical applications:
Analyzing product or movie reviews
Monitoring brand reputation
Enhancing customer service feedback analysis
Social media sentiment tracking

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how text data can be transformed into meaningful insights using machine learning techniques. By combining TF-IDF vectorization with Logistic Regression, we have built an efficient and interpretable sentiment classification model. The project is designed to be extendable to larger datasets and more advanced algorithms, making it an excellent starting point for anyone interested in text analytics and natural language processing.
